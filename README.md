# gRPC
This is the new [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) website, written on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  Here are a few key things to know about the site:
* Key variables are stored in `/config.toml`, for example `grpc_release_tag` which is used in various places throughout the site.
* If you're not familiar with Hugo, all content is stored in the `/content` directory.  Go there to edit anything on the site.  Images are stored in `/static/img`.  Check out the [Hugo Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for a quick intro to Hugo.
